# lncscore: identification of lncRNA from RNA-Seq data

lncScore is a Java-based software tool for predicting novel lncRNA directly from assembled isoforms of RNA-Seq data sets. We use a machine learning technique to integrate multiple sources of information that are predictive of lncRNA, and assess whether a given transcript is likely to be a novel lncRNA from RNA-Seq data.

With ~80 features, we achieved faster and reliable performance than previous 
methods. Our method will help researchers identify novel lncRNAs and determine 
the potential functional significance of these novel non-coding RNAs.
